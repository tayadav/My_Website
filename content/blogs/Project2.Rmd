**Biden's Approval Margins**
This assignment involves analyzing the poll approval for the US president. Here, I'll again start by loading the libraries which I might need to do my analysis: and a bit of cleaning the data: 

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
```

```{r fix date and calculate net approval rate, cache=TRUE}

# Imported approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

#Using `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(enddate = mdy(enddate))

```

*What I did is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, I used `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.*

```{r net approval margin for Biden}

#tidy data and calculate CI using formula
net_approval <- approval_polllist %>% 
  filter(!is.na(subgroup)) %>%
  #using lubridate to get week number
  mutate(week = isoweek(enddate),
         net_approval_day = approve - disapprove) %>% 
  group_by(subgroup, week) %>%
  summarise(mean_net_approval = mean(net_approval_day),
            sd_net_approval = sd(net_approval_day),
            count = n(),
            se_twitter = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            lower_ci =  mean_net_approval - t_critical*se_twitter,
            upper_ci = mean_net_approval + t_critical*se_twitter)
```

```{r Biden net approval rate plot, fig.align="center", fig.height=5, fig.width=14}
#plot Biden's weekly net approval rate
ggplot(net_approval, 
       aes(x= week, 
           y= mean_net_approval)) +
  geom_line(color = "red")+
  geom_point(color = "red")+
  geom_smooth(color = "blue",
              level = 0,
              size = 1)+
  #add orange line at zero
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, 
             color = "orange", 
             size = 2)+
  theme_bw()+
  #add confidence band using calculated CI
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_ci, 
                  ymax = upper_ci),
              alpha=0.3,
              fill = "grey",
              color = "red") + 
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Approval Margin (approve-disapprove) for Joe Biden",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls by different subgroups",
    x = "Week of the year",
    y = "Average Approval Margin (approve-disapprove)")+
  #differentiate between Adults, All polls, Voters 
  facet_wrap(vars(subgroup))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-15,10,2.5))

```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 4` and `week 25`. 

```{r}
net_approval_4_25 <- net_approval %>% 
  filter(week %in% c(4, 25)) %>% 
  mutate(
    ci_width = upper_ci - lower_ci) %>% 
  select(subgroup, week, lower_ci, upper_ci, ci_width)

net_approval_4_25
  
```

From the results, I can clearly see that for all subgroups, the confidence interval for Biden's net approval rate has been narrower from week 4 to week 25. Especially for Voters subgroup, the width confidence interval has been drastically decreased from 16.84 to 6.85. I assume this is because as after Biden has been elected for a longer period of time in week 25 (almost half a year), all adults including his voters would become more clear about their approval or disapproval to the president. After Americans took over 25-week time to evaluate their new elected president, they would probably have a clearer attitude towards Biden's policy changes, administration and national strategies. These clearer perceptions then result in this decreasing confidence interval trend.
