```{r fix date and calculate net approval rate, cache=TRUE}

# Imported approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

#Using `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(enddate = mdy(enddate))

```

*What I did is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, I used `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.*

```{r net approval margin for Biden}

#tidy data and calculate CI using formula
net_approval <- approval_polllist %>% 
  filter(!is.na(subgroup)) %>%
  #using lubridate to get week number
  mutate(week = isoweek(enddate),
         net_approval_day = approve - disapprove) %>% 
  group_by(subgroup, week) %>%
  summarise(mean_net_approval = mean(net_approval_day),
            sd_net_approval = sd(net_approval_day),
            count = n(),
            se_twitter = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            lower_ci =  mean_net_approval - t_critical*se_twitter,
            upper_ci = mean_net_approval + t_critical*se_twitter)
```
