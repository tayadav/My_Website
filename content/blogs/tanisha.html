<p>Born and brought up in Delhi, the capital on India.I am reading for the Masters in Analytics and Management degree at London Business School and wish to undertake a career in tech, and more specifically in either Fintech or in music tech.</p>
<p>Having worked at the <em>BlackRock India</em> Investment Accounting business (IAG) for over two years straight out of university, I developed a broad understanding of financial world and clients. I also had the opportunity to understand deep implication of the data
analytics on the finance industry. Over these two years with the firm, I became a critical resource of the team and gained a reputation of being proactive, quick learner and a team player.</p>
<p>At LBS, besides achieving my professional goals, I am very keen on meeting people from all over the world and exploring new places. Outside of the academic and professional framework, I love playing badminton (I do not know where you are reading this from) and squash.</p>
<p>Here below is my CV, and feel free to reach out:</p>
